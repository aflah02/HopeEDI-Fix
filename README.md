# The Duality of Hope: A Critical Examination of Controversial Annotations in HopeEDI

This repository contains the reannotated dataset for the HopeEDI task (English variant) with a class. Please read [tiny paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r6QZ8YKSBd) to understand why this was deemed necessary.

We base our annotations on the dataset present on [HF](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hope_edi). You can trivially join back the dataset by doing a replace based on the 'Statement' column values.
